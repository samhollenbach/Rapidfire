# _Rapidfire v1.0_

_Rapidfire_ is a networked side-on 2D shooter. The objective is to kill the other player before they kill you.

_Rapidfire_ was made in Unity 5.5.1 by Lawson Busch, Sam Hollenbach and David McNichols. 

## Building _Rapidfire_

_NOTE: You will need to have Unity 5.5.1 or above installed to run this game. Click [here](https://unity3d.com/) to install Unity if you have not already downloaded unity._

To run _Rapidire_:

1. clone this project from GitHub to your desired directory. 

2. Open this directory in Unity.

3. In the top left corner of unity, under the Hierarchy tab, you should see 4 scene files, one of which is labeled _Start_. 

- If you do not see the start scenes, double click the _Assets_ folder in the Unity project window in the bottom left corner of Unity to open _Assets_. Then click and drag the each of the four sene objects from _Assets_ into the space under the Hierarchy tab. (These scenes have the unity logo as their picture).
  
4. Double click the "Start" scene to open it. You should now be able to run the game by either pressing the play button at the top of the Unity client, or pressing Ctrl-B (Command-B on Mac) to build and run a standalone version of the game.

## Using _Rapidfire_

Once in the game, press the Play button to enter the Lobby scene. Once in the Lobby scene:

- To host a game click "LAN Host(H)", this will take you to the host lobbby. Next, share your IP with the person you want to play (find your IP with [this](http://www.whatsmyip.org/) tool) and wait for them to join.

- To join a game enter the IP of the Host player into the textbox next to "LAN Client(C)", and then click this button to enter the host lobby. 

_NOTE: Rapidfire is LAN only, meaning host and client will either need to be run on the same wifi network._

When both players are visible in the lobby, click "Start" to set yourself as Ready. Once both players are Ready, you will enter a _Rapidfire_ match.

## Controls

The horizontal movement is controlled by the _A_ and _D_ keys (or arrow keys). Either _W_ or _spacebar_ can be used to jump. Use your mouse/trackpad to aim, and click to shoot. You may hold down the mouse click to repeatedly fire. Press _Esc_ to quit the _Rapidfire_ match.
